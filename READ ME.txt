Armada released the Emergency Shut Down Tool publicly for Orcus, which means that trolls
and anyone who knows your IP address can cripple your operational server. I have created
a point of concept that prevents the tool from shuting down your server, encrypting your
database, and removing all clients connected to your server. I believe that it was a bad
move to release the tool to the public as it's essentially a backdoor to any internet
facing Orcus server, it's too powerful to be giving out to anyone. If you want to figure
out how to modify the Orcus server yourself you'll need to unpack the Costura Fody
embedded assembly Orcus.Server.Core.dll within the Orcus server resources, in there you'll
find the authentication for the Emergency Shutdown.
